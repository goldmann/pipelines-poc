# POC

NOTE: This is a PoC that may change at any time. Some things may be outdated or even
in contradiction with other parts.

## Directories

* `src/main/java` -- implementation of the model classes.
* `src/main/resources/definitions` -- definitions of components, groups and products to help visualize interactions between these.
* `src/main/resources/pipelines` -- definition of example pipelines within the system
* `src/main/resources/tekton` -- a working example of a component build pipeline using Tekton
