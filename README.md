# POC

NOTE: This is a PoC that may change at any time. Some things may be outdated or even
in contradiction with other parts.

## Directories

* [`src/main/java`](.src/main/java) -- implementation of the model classes.
* [`src/main/resources/definitions`](.src/main/resources/definitions) -- definitions of components, groups and products to help visualize interactions between these.
* [`src/main/resources/pipelines`](.src/main/resources/pipelines) -- definition of example pipelines within the system
* [`src/main/resources/tekton`](.src/main/resources/tekton) -- a working example of a component build pipeline using Tekton.
